Basic Program:

  awk '<conditional/pattern> {<action/output>}' <input_file>

awk - runs awk (or gawk if installed and configured properly) program in quotes
<conditional/pattern> - each input line is line compared against
{<action/output>} - action performed on each line that matches the pattern
<input_file> - input file, data processed on line at a time

Interactive program:

  awk '<conditional/pattern> {<action/output>}'

Run just like the program above except no file is read. Each line is processed
after it is typed

File Program:
 
  awk -f <program_file> <input_file>

Reads awk program from file, processes each optional input file

<conditionals/patterns> are optional for all programs. If left off the program,
  each line is processed by the <action/output> section
<input_file> is optional and can included multiple files. If empty, program is
  run with an empty input and allows user to enter line values from the terminal
  If multiple files are provided, processes files in order, on after the other

Output can be piped to other programs, such as sort:

  awk -f <program_file> <input_file> | sort
